# cli-matex
Compact [sub]command line parsing library, for Elixir. Perfect for scripting (who said Elixir is not good for scripting?).

Especially when scripting, you should write interesting code, not boilerplate. Command line apps are usually so tiny that there is absolutely no reason why your code should not be self-documenting. Things like generating help text and parsing command flags/options should not hinder productivity when writing a command line app.

While not a port, this work is inspired by https://github.com/l3nz/cli-matic
